## Example

#### Use with example ip: 192.168.1.82.
To make a server we add a listener, 

```console
python main.py -ip 192.168.1.82 -p 5555 -l
```

To make a client,

```console
python main.py -ip 192.168.1.82 -p 5555
```

After server and client are connected, the client can execute code
on the server.
